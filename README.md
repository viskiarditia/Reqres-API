## Introduction

[Reqres](https://reqres.in/) is a popular RESTful API that provides mock data for various endpoints, making it an ideal candidate for testing and development purposes. This project aims to showcase how to automate the testing of Reqres API endpoints using different programming languages such as Python, Java, and more.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (for Python tests)
- [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) (for Java tests)
- Any additional dependencies or libraries specified in the respective test files.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/reqres-api-automation.git

Change to the project directory:

cd reqres-api-automation

Install any required dependencies (if any) and customize the project as per your needs.
